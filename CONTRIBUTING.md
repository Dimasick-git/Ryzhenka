# Contributing to Ryzhenka

Thank you for helping improve Ryzhenka — contributions are welcome. This document explains the minimal steps to get your change merged quickly.

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch named `feature/your-topic` or `fix/issue-number-description`.
2. Keep changes focused and small; one logical change per pull request.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-visible changes and add tests where applicable.
4. Use clear commit messages and a descriptive PR title and body.
5. If your change affects bootloader or low-level configs, add compatibility notes and testing steps in the PR.

Coding style:
- Keep markdown clean and readable.
- For scripts, prefer Python 3.10+ and add minimal dependency declarations in `scripts/`.

How contributions are reviewed:
- Core maintainers will review PRs and may request changes.
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge and tag releases.
