Full changes and important notes (v5.0.0)
- Tuner: upgraded to v8.0 — added Performance/Standard/Economy profiles, better profile save/rollback.
- Atmosphère: compatibility with 1.9.5+; security patches for network stack applied.
- sys-clk: reworked power-profiles, improved integration with Tuner, added new power-saving modes.
- Modules updated: Ultrahand (theme management improvements), Status Monitor (better temp/battery telemetry), FPSLocker (fixes for jitter in some titles).
- Installer: automatic `emummc` backup on EmuNAND creation and preflight checks for critical configs.

Upgrade recommendations:
- Take a full backup of emummc/NAND and your SD image before upgrading.
- Review `hekate_ipl.ini` and `payloads` for custom edits — some legacy settings may conflict with new profiles.
- After install, open Ultrahand → Tuner and select the recommended profile for your device (Handheld/Docked).

Verification and signatures:
- Verify SHA256 of archives if provided in the release (look for `SHA256SUMS` or signatures).
- Example (PowerShell):
	- `Get-FileHash .\Ryazhenkabestcfw.zip -Algorithm SHA256`

Known issues:
- Some users may need to recreate sys-clk profiles manually after upgrade if old settings conflict.
- Older homebrew modules may be incompatible with newer sysmodules — check `CHANGELOG.md` for compatibility notes.
