## Quick install (summary)

Warning: Using custom firmware can void warranty and may result in bans for online use. Proceed at your own risk.

1. Download the release archive from: https://github.com/Dimasick-git/Ryzhenka/releases
2. Extract the archive to the root of your SD card (backup first).
3. Verify presence of `hekate_ipl.ini`, `payloads`, `atmosphere/` folder, etc.
4. Boot the console into your chosen payload (Hekate / Fusee, RCM method of your choice).
5. Select the desired profile (SysNAND / EmuNAND) and boot.
6. On first boot, open Ultrahand / Tuner and confirm sysmodules are installed and active.

Tips:
- Keep a copy of your NAND or emuMMC before making major changes.
- Do not go online from a modified SysNAND unless you know what protections you're using.

## EmuNAND (short guide)

EmuNAND creates an isolated NAND copy for experiments and homebrew testing.

1. Boot into Hekate / bootloader.
2. Choose EmuNAND â†’ Create EmuNAND from SysNAND (or the equivalent option).
3. Wait until creation finishes and reboot into EmuNAND.
4. Check EmuNAND status in Ryzhenka Settings â†’ System Info â†’ NAND Type.

Keep saves and important backups outside the device while experimenting.

## Tuner (Ryazhenkabestcfw Tuner) â€” features

- Overclock/undervolt CPU, GPU and RAM with preset profiles
- Save and load tuning profiles and backups
- Live integration with sys-clk and overlays for real-time monitoring
- Preset quick actions: Performance, Economy, Standard (v8.0+)

Always apply tuning changes gradually and monitor temperature and system stability.

## Troubleshooting (common issues)

- Firmware won't boot: check payload and `hekate_ipl.ini` correctness
- EmuNAND issues: restore backup and recreate EmuNAND
- High temperature after tuning: reduce the profile and test stability
- Homebrew not visible: check `switch/` folder on SD and file integrity
